## User features
- Easy to install [demo](https://github.com/Szybet/InkWatchy/wiki/Trying-out-the-demo-firmware) (no compiling!)
- [Modular and configurable](https://github.com/Szybet/InkWatchy/blob/master/src/defines/templates/gifnoc-template.h), a lot - if you disable a thing, it's not being compiled, it's like it was never there
- A lot of [watchfaces](https://github.com/Szybet/InkWatchy/wiki/Watchfaces)
- Full weather info via open meteo api in charts, 16 day forecast + On watchface
- Calendar show of events, their time and description from an ICS file (So any calendar should sync)
- Alarms
  - Basically unlimited ammount of them
  - Quick alarms setting
  - Pomodoro timer
- A book reader
   - With pages changable by moving your hand
   - Support for many books
- Interactive watchface by using watchface modules (Apps which are shown on the watchface directly).
    - Bitcoin module, with a "Big" mode to be truly a "bitclock"
    - A simple network module
    - A small conway game of life module
    - Image gallery module
    - Calendar module, to view the nearest event
    - Book module, to view the book text all the time
    - Alarm module, to see when the next alarm rings
    - Api module, to send button presses over the network (experimental)
- Debug menus to check on things on the fly (for example, a 3D demo of the accelerometer axis, to check if it works)
- Battery life features:
   - Configurable wake up every x minutes at night, at default it's between 23-06 every 45 minutes
   - A menu to manually, or after certain battery percantage drop enable these features:
      - Disable wake up - The watch will sleep until you press a button, this extremely improves battery life
      - Disable all vibrations - The vibration motor is heavy for the battery
- A "vault" which allows to save encrypted images to the watchy and view them if provided the correct PIN. All generated dynamically via a script. Uses AES128 cbc/ecb. Example use is a backup phone book, bitcoin key backup in the form of a QR code
- Games / Fun
   - Blockchy, a tetris like game
   - Pong game
   - Conway game of life
   - Small video player
- Experimental heart rate monitor (Just a proof of concept, works best on Yatchy)
- Reset cause shower. If your battery will be the cause of a reset, you will be informed about it on boot.
- ~~I integrated https://github.com/risinek/esp32-wifi-penetration-tool to this firmware as a service. I won't provide support for it or give any advice how to use it. Use for your own responsibility, don't do illegall stuff. Seriously.~~
- ~~https://github.com/ckcr4lyf/EvilAppleJuice-ESP32 too. the same story as above.~~ <sub>Those 2 options were removed because I updated the build system and didn't bother to make it work with it, with some cmake you should be able to easily re-add those features, I you can't use cmake, then you shouldn't probably use either of those features anyway</sub>

<summary><h2>Code features</h2></summary>

This list is outdated ;)

It doesn't use the watchy sub-class but it uses the same libraries. With that in mind, those are further diffrences from other firmwares:
<sub>Every small text is a reason why I was mad enough to rewrite everything myself...</sub>
- Welcome to contributions!
- It's splitted into files and folders <sub>In my opinion a file that has 5k lines is heresy</sub>
- It's function - not object based for the reason above and to make it easier for beginners to use
- It uses free rtos tasks where needed
- All resources like images, fonts, books are converted into variables dynamically via scripts. Editing images, changing font spacing is just one click. <sub>I can't believe I was the first to make this that way</sub>
- The Ui is dynamically written. There are functions to do it eassly. Adding a new menu is just a few lines for example<sub>It's not just a collection of drawBitmap</sub>
- It has a "manager" and design for various apps to run eassly
- Has logs via serial. They can be disabled that they don't get compiled with changing one define - and the code doesn't look bad because it's a macro. Amazing <sub>Yea, this is a feature compared to other ones I have looked at</sub>
- Uses libraries instead of pure calls to NTP or open weather
- Many configurable values via defines in config.h
- Many debugging tools in config.h
- Most UI is rendered only when needed / values it's showing changed. Good for battery life
- <sub> Proper variable naming and camelCase everywhere</sub>
- LittleFS is used instead of NVS. Which means better code, logs in file system. Resources not uploaded on every program change. Awesome
- Various tasks which speed up the debugging / development process (`resources/tools/other/tasks`)
