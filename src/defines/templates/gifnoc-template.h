// GSR watchfaces
// Because of the ways they are written (even in native watchyGSR) they will provide worse battery life than native inkwatchy watchfaces -
// Because they write everything every minute, unlike inkwatchy watchfaces which check what needs to be rewritten
// If you plan to write a watchface specifically for inkwatchy, don't use this compability layer, please
// Also lp core for yatchy for those is not supported
// Also to note, they are all ported, the original authours can be found under those links (and github / google in general):
// All credits go to them :)
// Expect lower quality of those watchfaces functionalities (Watchy gsr still uses openweather map, we dont, so we remove that)
